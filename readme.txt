Highlights

1.	Missing data (referred as gap) is considered a crucial problem in any field of science. The gaps and hence, uneven sampling can strongly affect the processing, analyses and interpretation of the data. 
2.	Ambient noise recorded by broadband sensors covers a wide range of frequencies.

3.	The frequency content of the signal is one of the most important factors for seismological studies. The periodogram is a spectral estimator of signals.

4.	To apply a window on a signal in the time domain, the window is multiplied by the signal, and the frequency response of the window is convolved with the frequency response of the signal to do the same task in the frequency domain.

5.	Stacking is one of the most important processes in many seismological studies and means summing and averaging traces. By stacking, random data will be reduced


Summary

The use of seismic ambient noise to estimate velocity and attenuation structures and estimate variation in these parameters on Earth has grown significantly in recent decades. In recent years seismic ambient noise has had an essential role in seismology. However, gaps in recorded time series for various reasons cause significant problems in ambient noise processing. This study aimed to fill these gaps using time series with suitable frequency contents. To achieve this goal, a gap was applied to a continuous time series, and a time series with the same length as the gap, from after the gap, was chosen as the primary signal, to make it more similar to the gap as much as possible. To fulfill this, a moving (step by step) periodogram with various windows was used on time series before and after the gap. By stacking these periodograms, a reference periodogram was obtained as a suitable indicator of the frequency content of the gap, which was used to improve the frequency content of the primary signal. This study suggested that improving the frequency content of existing time series would be an advanced technique to tackle the lack of data in seismic ambient noise.
